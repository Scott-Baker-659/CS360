Summarize the requirements and goals of the app:

The goal of the application is to provide users with a means of keeping track of their warehouse/store inventory. This would let users keep track of what items they have, how many of each item they have, as well as add/remove items from the inventory all together.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs?

The screens needed were a login screen to prevent un-authorized access, an inventory display screen that lets the users see the inventory itself, and a search screen that lets the users find specific items from the inventory. Keeping things segmented this way kept the main intention of the user centralized and helped to keep things simple.

How did you approach the process of coding the application?

I started with getting the basic functionality of the application working properly and then worked getting the different screens/activities to work together. This allowed me the ability to know when/where something went wrong with the application, and could easily figure out where the issue was.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional?

I would constantly test the application to see if it would function properly after making any changes to the code/application. This was very important because it showed me when I included code that caused the application to malfunction/crash. I could then quickly figure out where the issue was and hopefully resolve it.

Where did y9ou have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I would not call it innovating as much as consulting stackoverflow and youtube. These two sources, as well as github itself, proved to be very valuable tools that helped me to figure out/establish some level of functionality for the application.

What part of the application were you successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was successful with implementing the recycler view, for the most part. I was able to effectively give the user an image of the item, its title, and a description for each of the inventory items.
